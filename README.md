## 🧠 Project Overview

StegoVault was built to explore secure communication through steganography using web technologies. Inspired by real-world spy concepts, it allows anyone to **encode secret text messages into images** and decode them later — with an optional password.

The project was created as part of a self-driven internship goal to combine **learning frontend + backend development**, understand **how data can be hidden in plain sight**, and experiment with **AI-generated design ideas**.
